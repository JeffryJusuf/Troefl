As she continued her journey, she stumbled upon an old, abandoned cottage. The door of the cottage had a small lock that looked like it could fit the key she had found.

She opened the chest and discovered it was filled with gold coins and precious jewels. Overwhelmed with excitement, Lily knew she had found a hidden treasure. She decided to share her discovery with the villagers, and together they used the treasure to improve their village, making it a better place for everyone.
